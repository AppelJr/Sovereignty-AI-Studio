# Sovereignty AI Studio

This is the main dedicated branch. All changes by Claude Grok/Ara GPT/Codex Copilot must be made in their dedicated branch. Do not push directly to main. Create a Pull Request for review.


Sovereignty AI Studio is a self-hosted, offline-first AI control surface and
supporting service stack. The primary user interface is the KODER dashboard in
[`SGHv119.html`](SGHv119.html); Python and Node services provide local routing,
agent orchestration, and optional self-hosted integrations.

## What is included

- **KODER dashboard:** a plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript control surface.
- **Python bridge:** local AI and orchestration services on port `9897`.
- **Node bridge:** HTTP/API proxy on port `9899`.
- **MCP server:** an offline JSON-RPC server over stdio with workspace-bounded
  tools.
- **Self-hosted stack:** Docker Compose definitions for the backend, database,
  Redis, gateway, and optional services.

## Quick start

### Local development

Requirements:

- Python 3.11 or later
- Node.js 20 or later

Install the checked-in runtime dependencies. This creates `.venv` and installs
both Node workspaces; it does not create credentials, substitute a model, or
make runtime network calls:

```bash
./INSTALL.sh
```

For an air-gapped workstation with pre-populated Python and npm caches, use:

```bash
./INSTALL.sh --offline
```

The installer does not download or substitute an AI model, generate
credentials, or enable unapproved providers. Configure an approved local
inference provider separately before submitting AI work. Then start the local
services:

```bash
./START_SERVER.sh
```

Open the dashboard at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:9898/SGHv119.html
```

The launcher starts these loopback services:

| Service | Address | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KODER dashboard | `http://127.0.0.1:9898` | Static dashboard |
| Python bridge | `http://127.0.0.1:9897` | Local backend |
| Node bridge | `http://127.0.0.1:9899` | HTTP/API proxy |

Press `Ctrl+C` in the launcher terminal to stop all three services.

### MCP server

The MCP server works without network access or API keys:

```bash
python3 mcp_server.py
```

It defaults to `SG_MCP_MODE=offline`. Set `SG_MCP_WORKSPACE` to restrict a
client to a specific directory. See the [MCP server source](mcp_server.py) for
the available tools and configuration.

#### Agent sanitation workflow

`workspace_analyze` is a local, read-only helper for Python and JSON syntax
validation plus cleanup findings, such as trailing whitespace and Python tab
indentation. Its diagnostics include the file, line, column, severity, rule,
message, and a safe suggested action. It does not start a shell, make network
calls, accept credentials, or edit files.

Run each agent against the checkout of its dedicated branch by setting
`SG_MCP_WORKSPACE` to that checkout. Hidden files and likely credential files
(`.env`, token stores, keys, certificates) are unavailable to listing, reading,
and analysis tools. Review diagnostics and make edits explicitly in that
branch; commits and pull requests remain the accountability record.

### Container services

The self-hosted service stack is defined in
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). Review its required environment
variables and production defaults before starting it:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Network and deployment modes

The default runtime is offline and loopback-only. `SG_NETWORK_MODE` supports:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `offline` | Default. Loopback-only; no external or LAN requests. |
| `hybrid` | Loopback plus hosts explicitly listed in `SG_LOCAL_NETWORK_ALLOWLIST`. |
| `online` | Remote traffic only when `SG_ENABLE_REMOTE_NETWORK=1` is also set. |

The Node bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. For LAN, device, or public
deployments, configure TLS and explicit access controls. The dashboard must
disclose network activity; bridge network status is available at
`/api/network/status`.

For air-gapped or local-network deployments, use a private local CA. Public
TLS through Let's Encrypt is an explicit online deployment option. Full details
are in [Offline runtime and transport policy](docs/OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md).

## Development checks

```bash
npm run check
make py-test
make py-lint
```

## Security

- Do not commit credentials, API keys, certificates, or `.env` files.
- Keep core workflows functional without external services where possible.
- Use loopback-only development defaults and explicit consent for networked
  operation.
- Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and the
  [offline runtime policy](docs/OFFLINE_RUNTIME.md) before deployment.
